You can't write if you don't write.

My creative flaw has always been when I'm depressed, it's extraordinarily hard to write. Or do much of anything, really.

If I'm being honest, this whole year has been enough to put and keep me in a funk. The only consistent thing is the fact that I keep waking up and expecting a different outcome everyday.

That’s the definition of insanity, isn’t it? Expecting something new while repeating the same rhythms of struggle.

And yet, even in the thick of it, small moments reminded me that the world hadn’t given up on me.

If anything, this period in my life has taught me more than many others before this. If I were to polish this year up for a résumé, my new ‘soft skills’ would include:

- An appreciation for free days at the Dallas Museum of Art
- Free books on Kindle (and local library apps)
- How much I absolutely adore my animals (and how they are completely content in life with what they have)
- A healthier lifestyle (can't eat junk food when you can't afford it)
- Just how far a dollar can go - and how easy it is to fall into a desperate situation

I'm so grateful to be surrounded by the absolute best family on the planet. When I was at my lowest, they padded my fall and lifted me right back up.

And slowly, we're on our way again.
