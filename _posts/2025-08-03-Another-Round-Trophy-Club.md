*It's about damn time*.

If I were someone who was good with stats and whatnot, I'd be willing to bet money that this has been my longest stretch sans any sanctioned play since I really started playing tournaments in 2020.

Why? 

Two main reasons:

1. I'm a baby when it comes to the heat. It's summer. In Texas. 
2. I've been both simultaneously super busy and also, well, not.

The interesting piece in addition to this being my longest dry spell in five years is I've been playing less **overall**.

Over the past five years, I'd say I spent no less than 3-4 rounds per week at the course. Realistically, it was closer to 7+ rounds. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

This summer? I averaged about 3 rounds per week. Total. At one point, my uDisc streak was almost in danger of ending. (Thankfully, I got in a round that Thursday. 105 weeks strong and counting!)

Now, don't get me wrong. I don't love this. I wholeheartedly call the disc golf course my church. It's where I find peace and deal with whatever shit I've got going on internally. To *not* be playing as often is most certainly **not a good time**.

But at the same time, we've gotten so much done on our house in the country that I'm not mad about it at all. Hashtag no ragerts.

Seriously though. At some point, I'll make a post about all the work we did (hopefully sooner than later) because I don't have the words right now to emphasize how amazing it all looks. Even with a lot left to do.

With that being said, I'm heading into Saturday's tournament at [Trophy Club](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/91313#FPO) fairly clear-minded and with minimal expectations.

Okay, as I typed that, I realized that was a blatant lie to myself. Of course I have expectations.

I **want** to win - of course. But I can only control myself.

My goal is to shoot at least **900+** rated for both rounds - but honestly, **920** would be better.

More than anything: I want to be excited to be playing my favorite sport, surrounded by absolutely amazing people.
