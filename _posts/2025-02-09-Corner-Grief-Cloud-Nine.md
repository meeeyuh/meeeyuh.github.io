I'm not sure what I expected my first blog post to contain—but I'm pretty sure it wasn't this.

#### Life is an Actual Rollercoaster 🎢
---
In the past couple of weeks, I've had a handful of actual life-altering events occur in my life. Maybe even more than that if you pull back the timeframe to the very beginning of the year. Honestly, let's just call it an even three:

1. Qualifying for my first ever Disc Golf Pro Tour event
2. Getting engaged to the love of my life
3. Losing the closest person I could ever call a sister

I want to write more in-depth about each, but to be honest with you, I'm still a bit numb from the most recent event. It's hard to express excitement and enthusiasm when my heart is pulling just as hard toward sadness and grief.

Right now, I'm doing my damndest to find a happy medium—to establish a new status quo where the future no longer holds the physical presence of one of the most beautiful souls to exist in this world.

#### 1000-Rated Wall Builder 🧱
---

Death has stirred a variety of emotions in me in the past. Typically, I leaned more toward the depressive side of the spectrum. I let myself succumb to grief and used it as a crutch for self-destruction.

And boy, I was a **1000-rated self-destructor.**

It didn’t help that the situations I put myself in made that self-destruction easy. I didn’t open doors—or even windows—for support from others. And in a time when I needed it the most!?

I refused support. I shut everyone out and built a wall hundreds of feet high. For some reason, I felt like I had to take on every single emotion alone and let them consume me, bit by bit.

#### Adjusting My Approach 🤔
---

But this time, when we got the call that things were taking a turn for the worse, I found myself in a very different place than years prior—mostly mentally (but even physically).

The biggest difference? I actively **sought out** the comfort of my relationships. I leaned on my circle and allowed myself to be the one who needed a friend. And—to the surprise of probably no one other than myself—they **showed up**. They were _more than happy_ to offer a shoulder when I needed to cry and to provide their natural energy and support.

#### BLESSED! 💗
---

Navigating the highs and lows of the past six-ish weeks has been easier knowing I’m not alone in this crazy world. It also helped me avoid sinking too deep into my own misery because I kept an open ear and eye for what was happening in _their_ lives, too. That gave me a healthy perspective and, more than anything, reminded me to be **grateful.**

And right now, I’m **so** grateful. I’m humbled. I’m blessed with so many reasons to be happy. I’m broken by the things out of my control, by yet another piece of my heart being snatched away by the afterlife.

But—I’m here. And I’m so happy about that.

🖤

#### How Can You Help? 🙏🏽
---

Since I went into a whole spiel about leaning on my circle of support - it doesn't hurt to ask.

If you feel so inclined to help the family and contribute (literally ANYTHING), the GoFundMe link can be found [HERE](https://www.gofundme.com/manage/in-honor-of-erica-renee-gonzales).

I also sincerely mean it when I say even something "as small" as sharing with your friends or by word of mouth - it goes so incredibly far.
