description: A brutally hot day, shaky putting, and low practice heading into Trophy Club left me questioning whether to finish. But by pushing through, I landed on the podium â€” and was reminded that if I want more, I have to put in the work.

A bit belated - but I owe it to myself (and any possible readers out there) a recap on [Trophy Club](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/91313#FPO) this past Saturday.

Truth be told, this was probably the least amount I practiced prior to a tournament in recent years. I tried a different approach this time in trying to... well, *care less*. Maybe care isn't the best word, but I tried to *stress less*. I wanted to enjoy myself more, especially after not playing a sanctioned event since [Miss McKinney](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/91309#FPO) back in May.

Unfortunately, my dear Subie has been undergoing some maintenance lately, so I had to take [[Louie]]'s 4Runner to Trophy Club, but it was mostly fine because he takes beautiful care of our vehicles. I never mind driving his car. However, mine has all the fun technology (i.e. CHARGING OUTLETS), and his slightly older (2001) does not. 

When I arrived on Saturday morning, I realized I had a cool 52% battery to get me through the day. Between my playlists, keeping score, and the occasional photo here and there, I knew I was gonna have to stretch it out. On a whim, I decided to forgo my music - which isn't something I usually do, but it was something different. Thankfully, both rounds my card mates were actually four of my friends each round, so I didn't mind not having any sort of musical background.

Round one had a bit of a shaky start. We started on hole 17 both rounds, which was fine. I personally prefer getting hole 18 out of the way ASAP because we have a rough relationship. ðŸ«  Most of my problems in both rounds came down to putting (or lack thereof) and the occasional bad drive. There were quite a few holes where I *did* give myself an opportunity for even birdie - but then I fucked up the putt. More on that later.

Round two was questionable in the beginning. I haven't played much summer golf because, well, I'm a big baby. The **most** I've played this summer is one full round per day. The MOST. So playing a second round, on one of the hottest days so far this summer (hello 100+F!) - your girl was already questioning her life decisions. I kept hydrating and even poured water on my head a couple of times. It was so hot that my hair dried within a few holes - when on a normal day, my hair can stay wet for actual hours.

The course crosses tournament central once you finish hole 9. Once we got to that point, we were more than halfway through the second round. I was incredibly warm and honestly beginning to feel a bit silly and slightly delirious out there. I knew I was pushing it physically. So much so, that I considered right then and there on that walk just telling the girls, "Hey, had fun, I'm done. See y'all next time." But I double checked the scores and surprised myself when I saw I was chasing the podium and tied with two other girls.

After some serious internal debate, I decided to push through. I could finish six more holes. Most of them wooded. A couple of them shorter than last time. If I could just finish strong and push on each hole, I had a chance.

I'm always so hungry for that sliver of a chance.

Unfortunately, I'd made too many mistakes round one and earlier in round two to have a chance at first or second, but I managed to squeak out third with one other gal, and honestly, I'm pretty happy with it.

I could have quit. I could have gone home and not one person would have felt any type of way about it.

But I didn't.

And even without practice. Without any sort of endurance in this heat to speak of. Without the dedication I **want** to give to practice, I managed to do *something*.

When I got home, [[Louie]] showered me in praise and affection, as he usually does after tournaments. But, in the lifelong coach I chose to marry, he reminded me: that's not all I had in me. I have **more**.

**But**.

I can't expect it to just - happen. I can't expect my skills and talents to just appear. I **have** to practice. I have to work at it. My putting. My upshots. My drives. Field work. Not just playing rounds and expecting to get better.

I've known this my whole life. I played competitive softball for the first two decades of my life nearly. I know what it takes to be an elite athlete. Now, I just need to do it.

And if you'll excuse me, I have some putting to do.
