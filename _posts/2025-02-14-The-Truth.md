## Unfinished Thoughts 🫥
---

I can't tell you how many empty drafts I have sitting in my "Digital Garden" right now. 

It's been hard to write.

Honestly, it's been hard to do much of anything. I suppose a form of depression has sunk in, although it's still different than other experiences I've had in the past. 

In some ways, it's also been very much the same.

## Loss Really is like an Onion - So Many Layers 🧅
---

Obviously, going through a loss in the family is enough to bring anyone down a couple of notches. 

Throw in this climate-based rollercoaster we've had in recent weeks, and that about sets me over the edge. By no one else's fault but my own, my winter attire is very sparse and limited. I suppose it boils down to I don't enjoy wearing a lot of layers. I hate the bulky feeling, and it also gets in the way of doing outdoor activities - especially disc golf. 

With that being said, it's been hard to get outside on specific recent days due to factors literally outside of my control. It's not that I *couldn't* have gone and practiced my putting or even jogged for a bit (something I've picked up in recent weeks and months). Sure, some of it was lack of attire, but most of it was an internal lack of motivation.

I'm sad, I guess. About the loss in my immediate family. More losses in our greater family. Losses among friends and coworkers. Losing jobs. Losing faith in... a lot just as a general whole, right now.

## When Your Mind is Running on Dial-up 🐌
---

It's hard to write because it's hard to think. I'm simultaneously thinking about 600 things and also absolutely nothing. 

There's a 50% chance I heard what you said. But what actually _sticks_? Even less. Some words reach me, but they don’t always _land._ It’s like my brain is running on an old, dial-up connection—some things come through, but most of it just buffers endlessly in the background. I might nod along, might even respond, but later, I won’t remember the details. It’s 100000% not that I don’t _care_—it’s that my mind is too cluttered to hold onto anything properly.

Ironically, a dear friend mentioned their general feelings the other day and put it way more eloquently than I ever could.

<blockquote>
  <p>Mostly I just feel kind of gross and irritated, like an old cat wanting attention but my owner (me) stubbornly refuses to pamper me. But when they reach out, I just bite them.</p>
  <p>— (c) 2025 <a href="https://dsriseah.com/">Sri</a></p>
</blockquote>

I'm really relating to this right now. In my mind, while all the love and support and kind words have been amazing to hear and so unbelievably thoughtful - my irrational mind sometimes gets irritated by it. 

Terrible, isn't that?

## It's Mi, Hi! I'm the problem, it's me! 💃🏽
---

I don't know. When I'm in this emotional state, sometimes I feel as though things don't matter. After an unknown number of well-received and well-intentioned support, my emotions hit a quota. And once that quota's been surpassed, I just... I don't wanna hear it anymore. 

But then again - I do.

Of course this doesn't make sense. I know that. You know that. Everyone knows that.

And because of that - this is the time in my emotional state where those walls come back and right up to where they used to be. A little easier to slide in from last time since there was already a spot for it.

It's like, I don't feel **worthy** of the support. What good does that do me? When no amount of support or love would bring back Erica. Or in an ideal world, not have caused any suffering in the first place.

But of course that's not how the world works. And that's why I can't let myself get into that mental state. Because when I do...

It's **not** rational.

## Just a Wee Bit of Downward Spiral 📉
---

When I'm not in a rational state, there's a domino effect in my life. 

It starts very small. I let some little things slip through the cracks which pave the way for bigger and bigger things to fall through.

I don't respond to one friend's message for a day, then two. Then a week. Before I know it, months have passed, and I can’t bring myself to reach out anymore.

I avoid writing because I hate dwelling on the negative. Then I go a week without writing, then a month. Eventually, I can’t even process those dark moments properly because I never gave myself the chance to work through them.

The internal panic sets in. I feel like I’m losing control—or at least the illusion of it. And suddenly, I _need_ help. But needing help triggers something in me, something I don’t fully understand yet. My fight-or-flight response kicks in, and instead of reaching out, I push people away. I lash out at those closest to me, convincing myself that distance is safer. That if I keep people at arm’s length, I can hold onto whatever balance I pretend to have.

Or maybe… what I _think_ people believe I have. Not what’s actually real.

## On Showing Up 💪🏽
---

Depression isn't always the same.

But I've been around to see its effects for way too long in my life - and I refuse to allow it to consume me as it has in the past. 

Writing this - *posting* this - is terrifying. It's freeing. I hope it shows I'm **not** perfect, and I have so much to learn and figure out about life.

I hope it shows I'm **willing** to learn. I'm willing to do what I need to do every day to become the best version of myself - even if that means just showing the fuck up.

If you’ve ever felt this way—like your emotions don’t make sense, like you can’t find the right words, like you’re both desperate for support and resentful of it—you’re not alone. 

And if you _haven’t_ felt this way, maybe this helps you understand those who do. 

Grief and depression don’t follow a neat script. They’re messy. They contradict themselves. 

And that’s okay.

🖤
