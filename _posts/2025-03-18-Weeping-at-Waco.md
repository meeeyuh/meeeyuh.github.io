description: I fought. I lost. I learned. My first DGPT event at Waco was an emotional rollercoaster- but I walked away knowing I belong.

I suppose the time has finally come to put words to "paper" regarding my whole [Waco](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/88277#FPO) experience.

Truth be told, I'm still mentally and physically exhausted to my core. But it's best to get everything down while it’s relatively fresh - even if it’s not pretty.

Also, this is likely to be a longer post. I don't want to filter my thoughts on this occasion.

Going into Waco, [my feelings](https://meeeyuh.github.io/blog/2025-03-09-Redemption/) were mostly of excitement. Confidence, even!

I felt as prepared as I could be - I put in my due diligence, practicing putting whenever I had a break; daily stretches to keep the late-thirty-something stiffness at bay; and treating my body with love.

Everyone kept encouraging me to just have fun and don't go in with **any** expectations. "Just enjoy the experience," they said.

And while I *did* want to do that - and **ABSOLUTELY DID** - there was the nagging part deep within me that wanted more. I wanted to prove myself. I wanted to show everyone that I deserved to be on the course with the elite, and that I could hang.

There were two moments in those three days that I cried. Only two.

The first was on day one - Friday.

[[Louie]] and I had warmed up quite a bit before my scheduled tee time at 9:50. We were at a course only five minutes down the road from the Beast. However, because this was a DGPT event, parking was different than I was used to in the past, and I nearly caused myself to be late!

That being said, we did make it with a few minutes to spare. And just after the two minute warning, and shortly after we had been given the course rules for the day and weekend, everything hit me all at once. 

I looked around and saw I was surrounded by DGPT and sponsor flags everywhere I looked. Professional disc golfers I'd only ever seen online and via social media were warming up just a couple hundred feet away. In fact, I was about to tee off with three of them! Spectators lined the wall along hole one, and two professional photographers were waiting in the bushes to capture our drives (and a very cute picture of Louie and myself). 

I couldn't help it. A lump swelled in my throat, and I fought back tears. A few slipped through, and Louie gave me a hug. He assured me I was meant to be here for a reason, and once again, to enjoy it.

*More than anything, I love that the DGPT photographers snagged this candid moment of us right before I teed off first round.*

I surprised myself the first few holes for playing relatively clean.

I surprised myself when I played the wooded holes even cleaner - mostly pars, a couple birdies, and plenty of opportunities to shoot an even lower score.

Coming out of the woods into the back holes, I was even.

I was shooting even amongst the elite women at Waco.

*Was I hanging in there*?

Everyone knew the forecast was going to be windy. Gusts of upwards of 45mph with west Texas dust blowing in at the same time. Everyone who's ever played the Beast also knows it's called Windy Waco for a reason. It's totally rare to have a calm wind round there. 

That being said, I'm **not** using the wind as an excuse. I knew days in advance. I knew what to prepare for, what discs to throw, and how I needed to play certain holes.

The first couple of holes out of the woods and into the open(ish) were touchy - but I managed to squeak by with a couple of double bogeys and one bogey. Then I stopped the bleeding for one hole and took a par.

The last three holes hurt even more than the five strokes I lost coming out of the woods.

On hole sixteen, because I hadn't bothered to practice or look closer at the caddy book (completely my own fault), I didn't realize the hole had been changed for this event to have a completely different OB and fairway. Per Louie, I didn't trust his advice and added another two easy strokes there.

Hole seventeen hurt a lot for more than just taking an extra three strokes.

Hole seventeen at the Beast is iconic - and for someone who throws predominantly righthand forehand (a.k.a. RHFH or flick), the lines set up perfectly for three well placed drives and an easy putt for par.

My first drive was pretty good. I was in a place to attack for my second shot and hopefully gain back some strokes. Instead, I didn't throw my disc on enough of a hyzer angle, and the strong winds kept it going completely straight and into the water. On my next throw, I threw from where my disc went out (thankfully at the bottom of the hill with an easier look at the basket). Once again, I threw a stable disc, this time with what I thought was plenty of hyzer - but the wind was a headwind this time. Too strong. It kept it straight where it passed way beyond the basket and into the Brazos river. 

In one fell swoop, I lost two of my go-to discs that I **needed** particularly for these gusty shots. Instead, I now had one stable driver left.

Walking up to hole eighteen, I felt pretty defeated. The thought to DNF (do not finish) even flashed my mind for the briefest of moments. But instead, I decided to just push through, finish out and see where I stood.

Well, because I lost said discs on the previous hole, my entire game plan for this hole was a bunch of question marks popping around in my head. I was completely lost on what to do and made a couple of silly decisions - one of which led to my final stable driver being lost in the pond on that hole.

Finally, I managed to putt out and finish the round. I knew I struggled badly in the open holes, but I suppose I didn't realize **how** badly.

*Little did I know this hole would single-handedly have me questioning my disc golf career.*

Watching the professionals play these events on the DGPT, I don't think it ever really hit me just how much mistakes can cost you when you're playing with the elite.

Not only do the elite throw further than I do, they also have more confidence out there. They're used to the spectators and the cameras and photographers and each other. They're used to this life. This traveling like nomads sometimes and crawling into your van after a long round just to grind later on at a fly mart to make some cash.

I didn't realize a lot about what life was potentially like on tour. And how hard these folks **grind**.

By the end of round one, I was DFL (dead fucking last).

By the end of the second round, I moved up one spot to 51st place.

Finally, by the end of Sunday, I was solidly in last / 52nd place.

I lost by four strokes to 51st place, and **fifty-six** strokes to 1st - Mrs. Kristin Lätt.

The car ride back home was pretty quiet most of the way. Neither of us had much to say.

He wasn't disappointed in me, but both of us knew my potential. Both of us knew how much I left out there.

---

When we got home, I took a much needed shower. Then I passed out for a solid four hours. When I woke up, we unpacked (we're the folks who need everything unpacked and organized when we get home - none of this letting it sit there for days).

Everything still felt pretty raw, and I wasn't sure what all I felt emotionally (just that I was feeling a **lot**).

We made a little dinner before settling in to watch the first round coverage from Waco for the FPO lead card (which included Kristin). As we sat there, I furiously studied what everyone did on each hole and compared it to my own shots. Frustrated, I saw where other than clearly the very elite players, I was actually hanging in there for a lot of the time. The shots I had, especially in the woods, were on a high competitive level.

I **had** hung in there after all - even though my place didn't show it.

The coverage is always split up into two parts - the front and back nine. At the end of each round, they always go over the leaderboard for whichever division they're showing which shows what position everyone is in after a certain point in the round. In this case, they showed where all the competitors in FPO were at in round one after the first nine holes.

I was tied for 19th place.

Not only was I even coming into the last six holes - I was well in contention to make the cash line at that point in time.

This was the second and last time I cried.

I *knew* in my heart and soul I had it in me to compete with the best of the best.

Somewhere deep in me, I **knew** it.

It hurts that I couldn't hang on. It hurts that I made no less than 33 mistakes out there over the course of three rounds.

But what's done is done (...it's in the past, it's ashes. Bonus points for the reference.)

*I can't say I ever gave up, but I certainly left a lot out there...*

I can focus on the mistakes all day. I know exactly when and where I went wrong on each and every hole.

What were some wins?
- I had the opportunity to play with elite touring professionals on every round - and they were some of the most down to earth people I've ever met, which was unexpected and calming (well after the fact LOL).
- I took some birdies on a variety of holes - this means I **can** do better going forward. And if I can string them all together... hell, I could be dangerous one day. (I even almost aced a hole - which would have been EPIC.)
- After that first day, I mostly kept my mental game together. (Key word: mostly.)
- We had a blast at the player party on the bridge Saturday night and were able to chat with friends and the community!

More than anything, this experience taught me that I **am** capable of being out here. I **can** hang (eventually). There is so much work that I need to do - and most of it isn't on the course believe it or not.

This past week was very strange for me. I don't think I truly realized how much effort and energy I was putting towards Waco.

Once we got home on Sunday afternoon, I crashed out. And for the entire week since up until today - I have been so tired. So sleepy and lethargic. If we're being honest, I've kinda treated myself and my body like garbage this whole week, other than maintaining a relatively healthy eating streak.

Somewhere in the middle of the week, it hit me that I was mid-wave of a mini depression, almost. 

I put **so** much energy and effort into prepping for Waco - every. single. day. up until that weekend. Whether I was tired, whether the weather was shit. It didn't matter. I didn't want any reason to come up with any excuses to my play when the big weekend finally hit.

Instead, I wore my poor freaking 36-year-old body down to the bone - physically, mentally, and certainly emotionally.

This week I also had to reflect and ask myself what was next from here? Yes, I have another tournament next weekend - but after the hype for Waco and playing a DGPT event, it almost feels like my balloon has deflated and I'm not quite as *excited*.

I know it'll come back soon, but if we're being completely transparent right now, your girl is at a mini-crossroads in life. One that I'll definitely dig deeper and figure out what it's all about.

But for now... we rest.
