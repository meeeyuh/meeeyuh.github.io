### The last time I wrote, I felt pretty raw.
---

A dear friend (one of the few who's seen these first few posts) challenged me to dig deeper. To write what I was _actually_ feeling during those rough moments.

It’s scary. I like to stay cool, calm, and collected - especially on paper. I almost feel like there's this unspoken pressure to come across polished and damn near perfect. 

But let me be clear: I am the furthest from perfect.

Still, writing those raw emotions was freeing! And if there’s anything I’m working on, it’s being **exactly that** - myself.

### Can someone *please* lighten the mood!? 🥹
---

Alright, now the reason I started this blog in the first place. Let's finally talk about disc golf!

Most recently, I played in a [tournament](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/87023#FPO) at Tom "[Old Man](https://udisc.com/courses/tom-mc-cutcheon-dgc-BnM7)" McCutcheon disc golf course in Lewisville, Texas.

Allow me to set the scene for you: this is one of my absolute favorite disc golf courses that I regularly play. It's not so much the level of difficulty (medium-ish depending on the weather 🌬️), but more about the scenery and shot variety out there.

The first seven holes hug the lakeside - stunning, but treacherous if you’re not careful. From there, hole eight shifts you into the **Gauntlet**: a tight, wooded stretch where we have three back-to-back flick shots (my favorite! 😜). The final seven holes? A blend of long shots, out-of-bounds, and plenty of trees 🌲🌲🌲- fair, but demanding.

### Tourney Prep & Superstitions 🔮
---

This event had two rounds on Sunday, so I followed my **normal routine** because... well, I'm _superstitious_.

That includes washing all of my discs the night before, drying them meticulously, and arranging them perfectly in my bag by color. I also make sure to lay out *all* of my clothes (socks included!) for both rounds - just in case I need to change for any reason. (Sometimes I don't.) Then the morning of, I like to leave ridiculously early and get there at least an hour before my tee time **just to be there**. (I have not so funny stories of NOT being there on time, and thanks - I hate it.)

Once I arrive at the course, I don't actually do too much afterwards. My main focus during those times is to get my mind right. That includes taking some deep breaths, visualizing my game plan, and figuring out which [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Imf1yaI24QSI1z4SS4GBw?si=b76f29e40038425f) I'm going to jam out to! Then just to loosen up a bit, I'll putt a handful of times and throw a few drives. But that's it. I keep it simple.

All of that said - that was what I did Sunday morning! It was extra chilly and breezy that entire day, so I made sure to layer up appropriately (more lessons learned from past mistakes 🥶). The warm hat and snug gloves helped **so** much - I barely noticed the cold, thankfully. I'm convinced this helped massively!

### Sit Down, Be Humble 😮‍💨
---

I had super high expectations of myself coming in what with the tens (maybe over a hundred?) rounds I've played at this very course. 

Every expectation I had? Gone instantly. The weather wasn’t giving me the round I knew I could shoot - so I had to shift focus fast. When I saw how windy it was, I realized that first round's focus needed to be on control and keeping mistakes to a minimum. 

Once we got away from the lake side and towards the "back" of the course (and less wind), I knew I needed to come out and make some moves. Both rounds, I hit hole eight’s basket for an easy birdie - which felt amazing. That hole isn’t a gimme. You have to hit your line perfectly - but the ace is there.

Both rounds, I played the "**Gauntlet**" holes fairly clean. I've been known to take both birdies *and* bogeys on those three holes (9-11) so coming out with pars (and only one bogey) both times felt pretty damn good. 🫡

The finishing holes during the first round were hit and miss for me. I stayed pretty clean, again considering the conditions, but I also made some mistakes out there. It left me with a decent four stroke lead going into the second round.

But - I *had* to keep it interesting in the afternoon. I did okay on the lake side, but I made some big mistakes. Specifically the last hole on that side - hole seven. What really hurt on that in particular was I had a great drive, a decent upshot, and an honest look at four. But I three-putted that hole which gave me a big ol' (un)lucky seven.

Ouch. 😩

### The Turning Point! 📈
---

But again, hole eight saved me - or rather, I saved myself. I came back and got the birdie - then I maintained the remaining holes. I took a par on every single hole except for the final one. Madalyn was on my ass. At one point, she had me by **five strokes**. I wasn’t out of it - but I had work to do.

I forced myself not to check the scores. It didn’t matter what the card said. What mattered was **what I needed to do** to fight my way back.

*Both rounds, my drives on hole eight were pretty spot on! This shows where it landed the first round after hitting the pin.*

### The Final Hole 😬
---

It all came down to our final hole (hole seventeen in our case). Madalyn and I were tied going into it, and internally, we both knew this was it. If we tied on this hole, we were going to a playoff - and I can promise you up and down I did ***not*** want that one iota. (The playoff holes would be on the lake side where I had struggled all day.)

Unfortunately, her first throw nicked a tree which kicked her immediately out of bounds. Even so, I knew it wasn't over - I had to play my game and get a par, which I am very capable of. As we played through the hole shot for shot, it became apparent that I would "win" this hole in terms of strokes, and I laid it up for an easy bogey to win the tournament by two strokes overall.

### Lessons Learned ✍🏽
---

Even though we had a small field, this win felt big—not just because of the competition, but because of what I proved to myself. I didn’t let the bad holes break me. I didn’t let a five-stroke deficit take me out. I fought through it, and I won.

And that’s the thing about competition - whether it’s on the course or in life. You’re going to have days where everything feels stacked against you. Where the wind is **literally** trying to knock you down. But you don’t stop. You adjust. You trust yourself. You keep throwing.

Because no matter how far behind you feel, you’re never really out of it - unless you decide you are. 

With that win under my belt, I'm holding tight for now. My next official event on the books is the [big one](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/88277). I may sneak in a flex or another tournament between now and then if the stars align. ✨ (And as of this post, I will indeed play [one more event](https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/88119#FPO) before Waco. This tournament will be at one of my really amazing friends' house slash personal disc golf course, so I can't wait!)

Let me know about your wins lately. Your losses. Your in-betweens! I want to hear them all and cheer you on.

🖤
