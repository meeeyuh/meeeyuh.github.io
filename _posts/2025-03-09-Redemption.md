### Just Flyin' By 🪁
---

Somehow, another week has flown by, and we're already in mid-March. Almost officially five years in this new post-COVID world. 🤯

Let me digress before I get too deep into that subject because that's an entirely different story.

### Nothing Like a Sunday Evening Reality Check 😯
---

Something I really enjoy doing every Sunday evening is to plan out my week in my Obsidian daily log. (Again, that will one day have its own dedicated post also.) I don't stay too rigid in my scheduling - just noting any appointments or important dates to remember. Any meetings or what have you. Of course, I like to keep note of what I'm doing every day - and that includes my disc golf tournaments. 

Tonight, as I sat down and looked at my calendar, it came of no surprise that this is Waco week. 

I noted it down under Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, as expected.

What I didn't expect is when I linked it to the [live event](https://www.pdga.com/live/event/88277/FPO/scores?round=1) on the PDGA site, the words "*Elite Series*" would hit me like a ton of bricks.

### I've Been Here Before (Sorta) 🥎
---

For those who haven't known me as long, I have a history with competitive sports. I've done many of them (volleyball, basketball, etc.), but the one I stuck with the longest was softball.

Softball was my life for most of my childhood. 

Evenings were spent at practice, and weekends were tournaments. (Pretty damn similar to today - just swapping out school hours for my 8-to-5 now.) I was never satisfied with whatever outcome we had - unless it was first place. Anything less felt not even worth my time. (Which was a terrible mindset to have; very similar to perfectionist tendencies I have today. Therapy, anyone?)

From a young age, in addition to becoming a meteorologist, the other plan was to become an Olympic softball player. I was never the kid who didn't know what they wanted to be when they grew up. I had **solid plans**. 😤

(Spoiler: Zero of those plans panned out for one reason or another.)

I ended up "quitting" softball competitively going into my senior year of high school. The only "college" softball I played was co-ed intramural which was slow pitch and not at all what I was used to my whole life. But for that brief period, I saw where softball could be *fun*. Jovial, even.

But fun wasn't what I was looking for. I thrived in competition and under pressure.

Pretty sure my future therapist is going to have a field day unpacking that one. 🫠

*None of my young softball photos were readily available, but I also loved volleyball until eventually I couldn't keep up both sports!*

###  Finding My Place 🔍
---

For years, I bounced between activities - searching for my "home". 

Co-ed volleyball was fun, but intense at times. Also time-consuming. A bit more time than I wanted to put in under a more rigid schedule. 

Bowling with family was a blast, but I plateaued at around a 130-average. And honestly? I didn't *want* to improve.

When COVID hit five years ago and the world flipped upside down, all of a sudden I had all the time in the world to spend time in nature throwing frisbees.

*Freshly single in a COVID world, I learned to navigate life with the help of disc golf and the community I met along the way.*

### The Sport That Changed Everything 🥏
---

And I became **addicted**.

I was awful at first, even though in 2020 I had already been playing disc golf for seven years.

But throughout that summer and the rest of the year, I improved exponentially. The growth and challenge was addicting. It was tangible. I could see and feel myself getting better and better. 

Over the past few years, I've maintained that excitement of growth. The passion of being out there with friends and community - coming together for a few hours in the day to just be ONE with each other.

*My amazing friends I've made along the way. We gather to play no matter the weather!*

### WE MADE IT, BABY! 😤
---

And now, this week, I've proven my skills and capabilities in disc golf to be part of the *Elite Series*.

I am part of the elite.

Am **I** myself elite yet? No. I wouldn't say so.

But I'm so close, I'm literally on the same stage as them.

I can feel it.

I'm here. I made it.

Maybe it's not the Olympics. 

Maybe I'm not able to travel around and play all the pro tour events across the country.

Not yet.

But It's [Waco](https://www.pdga.com/live/event/88277/FPO/scores?round=1). It's my shot. And I'm taking it.
